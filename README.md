### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript and React Native/Advanced React, I've been into the front end stack this whole year, and I'm updating all my practical studies in this profile.

I'm looking forward to work in the front-end area as a junior developer, and in the meantime looking for any freelance as well. 

I like to create smart interfaces with clear and concise features, I also am pretty confident with CSS using SASS and with a nice slice of the React universe and Vanilla Javascript.

Some adicional skills, libraries, frameworks or technologies
- Webpack
- TDD (Jest, Puppeteer)
- RestAPI consume and creation with node.js
- Express
- MySQL
- MongoDB
- Redux/ContextAPI
- Firebase
- SASS
